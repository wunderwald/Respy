# app

Electron app for real-time respiration biofeedback experiments.

Receives a normalized breath signal `[0, 1]` over WebSocket from `lsl_ws_bridge/` and renders one of several experiment frontends.

## Setup

```bash
npm install
```

## Run

```bash
npm start              # start screen — choose a frontend in the UI
```

Direct-launch shortcuts (skip the start screen):

```bash
npm run ibreath       # iBreath experiment
npm run bioGame       # biofeedback breath game
npm run trainingGame  # breath training game
npm run trainingGameControl # breath-controlled dino-style runner
npm run baseline      # resting-state baseline
npm run visualizer    # real-time waveform
```

## Add a frontend

1. Create `modules/<name>/<name>.js` exporting a default class:

```js
pushSample(value)         // called on every breath sample [0, 1]
setStatus({ type, text }) // called on stream connection changes
```

2. Create `styles/<name>.css`.
3. Add the path to `FRONTEND_PATHS` in `renderer.js`.
4. Add a script entry to `package.json`: `"<name>": "FRONTEND=<name> electron ."`.
